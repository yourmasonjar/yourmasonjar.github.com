It seems that since I changed the name of my photography business from Pixeldust Photography to Mason Jar Photography, I've done very little towards keeping this blog updated. It's super sad. I fully intend to change that in the coming weeks, though!

I thought I'd start with some senior portraits I had theÂ privilege to take during the spring. This beautiful young lady has already started her college adventure. She was such a pretty subject and we had a sunny, comfortable day to take photos. Here are a few of my favorites!
