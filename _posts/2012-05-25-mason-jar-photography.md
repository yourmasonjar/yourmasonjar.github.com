This is just a test post to see whether or not I'm going to like this "fancy" new blog. Actually, it's much more simple in layout and design, so I guess "different" is a better word.

This new blog is part of Mason Jar Photography-- the new name of my photog business! A name change seems simple enough, but it's been quite an undertaking considering the need for a new logo, website, blog, etc. My husband's been hard at work! There are still a few things that need tweaking, but for the most part, we're up and running as Mason Jar Photography!

I'm super excited about this new direction. Mason Jar Photography is mostly a name change, but was a change I felt I needed to make. You'll notice from the new site that it's very wedding-oriented. Don't be mistaken; I'm still available for family, newborn, senior and engagement photography. Hope everyone likes the new look!  Here are a few pics from a recent session....
