This sweet boy just celebrated his 1st birthday. I can't believe it's been a year since I photographed him as a newborn.. just a few days old. He's growing into a handsome, sweet toddler. I so enjoyed sharing a couple of hours with him and his sweet family while taking these photos. Here are my faves...

I've never been big on selective coloring... but I couldn't resist on this one...
