So, this is a very late blog post. I have a good excuse, though! Whenever this shoot took place, my husband and I were in the process of creating a new look for Mason Jar Photography. That included this blog and my website. Now that we are up and running again, I’m frantically trying to get things up to date and get some new stuff out there for y’all to see. 

This family has been graciously allowing me to photograph their lives for several years now. I always enjoy the time spent with them, and can’t believe how much the boys grow as each year passes. Becoming a part of their lives and being allowed to document their sweet family year after year is a great blessing! Here are some of my favorites from our time together!
