Paul & Andrea had a beautiful, private ceremony on their gorgeous property. I had so much fun capturing this special day for these two sweet clients. It seems my favorite shots are always taken outdoors in natural settings, and these pictures make me smile...a lot! I hope they love their photos as much as I love them! Here are several images from their awesome wedding!
