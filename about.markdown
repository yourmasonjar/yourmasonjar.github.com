# About Dedra

<img class="photographer" src="/images/photographer.jpg" alt="The Photographer"/>

I’m Dedra Fortenberry. I’m a wife, mom, nurse, a lover of all things chickens and homesteading and a forgiven daughter of King Jesus. These days, I’m also a photographer; thanks to my many wonderful clients! Photography is such a cool blessing in my life, one that allows me to meet awesome people and use my creativity.

I’m married to Eric, my high school sweetheart (yep, we’re THOSE people), and we live in a small town in central MS. He’s my best friend, my sidekick at many of my shoots and the brains on the web side of this business. This site is actually his handiwork. God's blessed us with two amazing kids. Throw in a silly schnauzer, a big fat bunny and several chickens, and it's rarely boring (or quiet) around here. 

My photography business was previously known as Pixeldust Photography. Mason Jar Photography is a pursuit in a somewhat different direction. The idea behind Mason Jar Photography is simple, fun photography that is true to what I love to create. It embodies my homegrown, Southern lifestyle, which I feel always manages to be reflected in my work. We’ve kept the site simple; hopefully the photos will speak for themselves. 

So, welcome to Mason Jar Photography.
